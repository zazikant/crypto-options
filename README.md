How this works?

1.Do your maths with futures crypto calculator and arrive at "initial margin" to be used and it's lot size. the same lot size will be in options.

2. In this calculator, enter your total capital, and adjust risk per trade percentage to match "Risk Amount" in calculator. this will give you TP % i.e.  = risk per trade %. 

3. keep 60 to 86% as multiplier for btc and eth respectively. or calculate from last 2 candles.

4. enter trade with 0.33% high of candle for short trade.
